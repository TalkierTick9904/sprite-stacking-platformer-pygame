# sprite-stacking-platformer-pygame
You wake up in some place surrounded by impenetrable walls, with a gun in your hand and you don't remember anything. You start walking around and collecting coins, after you have collected the last one, you hear the sound of a door unlocking. You walk through that door, teleport to the same spot with a different arrangement of items and... ALIENS?!?!?... WITH GUNS?!?!?

## Installation and launching
First, clone the project and navigate to the project folder:
```
git clone https://github.com/TalkierTick9904/sprite-stacking-platformer-pygame && cd sprite-stacking-platformer-pygame
```
Then you will need to install the `pygame` and `PIL` libraries, they are defined in the requirements.txt file, so just run this command:
```
pip -r requirements.txt
```
Then just run the `main.py` file, you can do this with this command:
```
python main.py
```
